# link-counter

The purpose of this chrome extension is to help track website usage. I found myself wasting too much time on Reddit and other social media websites, so I made this as a visual reminder of how much attention I was spending.

This extension creates a toolbar icon with a count of how many times you have visited web pages under the domain you are currently on. For example, if you visit pinterest.com, it will show a count of ALL Pinterest pages visited. If you navigate to facebook.com, it will display a count of all pages visited under Facebook.

The default timespan for showing page view counts is 7 days. The toolbar icon contains a dropdown for changing this default.
